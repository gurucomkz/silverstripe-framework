# 4.9.0 (Unreleased)

## Overview

## New features

### MySQL/MariaDB Int width in schema
MySQL 8.0.17 stopped reporting the width attribute for integers while MariaDB did not change its behaviour. 
This results in constant rebuilding the schema when MySQLSchemaManager expects a field to look like i.e. 
`INT(8)` and MySQL server reports it simply as `INT`. MySQLSchemaManager has been updated to detect the MySQL
server implementation and act accordingly. In cases when auto-detection fails, you can force the desired behaviour like this:
```yml
SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\MySQLSchemaManager:
    schema_use_int_width: true # or false when INT widths should be ignored
```
